## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Devcontainer (Recommended) ⚡

**One-click reproducible development environment!**

Prerequisites:
- Docker Desktop
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rtbooks/transparency.git
cd transparency

# 2. Test your setup (optional)
./test-devcontainer.sh

# 3. Open in VS Code
code .

# 4. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
# Everything else is automatic! ✨
```

After the container starts (~5-10 mins first time):
```bash
npm run dev  # Start developing!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No manual installation needed
- ✅ PostgreSQL pre-configured and running
- ✅ All dependencies installed automatically
- ✅ Consistent environment for all collaborators
- ✅ VS Code extensions pre-installed

See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for full details.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- npm or yarn

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/rtbooks/transparency.git
cd transparency

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# Set up database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed  # Seeds sample data for GRIT Hoops (development only)

# Start development
npm run dev
```

**Note:** Database seeding is automatically skipped in production environments. The production database starts empty and organizations are created through the application UI.

## 💡 Core Principles

### Radical Transparency
Every financial transaction is visible to the public (except anonymous donor names). No hidden fees, no obscured expenses. Complete audit trail of all changes.

### Temporal Data Architecture
All financial data is versioned with complete history. Query the state of any account or organization as of any past date. Never lose information - all changes are tracked and reversible.

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping
Professional accounting standards ensure accuracy and audit-ability. Every transaction affects two accounts.

### Donor-Centric
Donors can track their impact across multiple organizations and see exactly where their money went.

### Cost-Effective
Free tier for small organizations (<$50k annual revenue). Premium features at affordable prices. Never profit-seeking at the expense of charitable missions.

### Privacy-Respecting
Donors control their visibility. Anonymous donations are fully supported and respected.

## 🔒 Security

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- PCI DSS compliance via Stripe
- Row-level security for multi-tenancy
- Regular security audits
- GDPR compliant

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `npm test`
5. Commit: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
6. Push: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
7. Open a Pull Request

### Unused-code checks

- `npm run type-check` rejects unused local variables, imports, functions, classes,
  and parameters via TypeScript's `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`.
  Required positional parameters (for example, unused Next.js request arguments)
  use an `_` prefix. Remove unnecessary parameters instead of renaming them.
- `npm run check:unused` uses Knip to reject unused files and dependencies.
  Generated Prisma code is excluded; `pg` is retained for the Prisma PostgreSQL
  adapter, and the `stripe` binary is an externally installed developer tool.
- Both checks are enforced in CI; TypeScript also runs during `npm run build`.
  CI runs `npm run lint` separately because Next.js 16 no longer runs lint in builds.

Knip export/type analysis remains an additional review tool:
`npx knip --include exports,types`. It is not currently a CI gate; exported service
helpers and shared UI primitives still need a separate usage review.
